#MASHR Arduino based start here robot


##Introduction

MASHR is my attempt to build a start here robot for beginners. It is Arduino based, but didn't use a standard Arduino booard. An Romeo all-in-one robot controller (Arduino compatible with motor driver) has been used instead. The chassis is selfmade from a sheet of polystyrol (PS).
