= Introduction =

MASHR is my attempt to build a start here robot for beginners. It is Arduino based, but didn't use a standard Arduino booard. An Romeo all-in-one robot controller (Arduino compatible with motor driver) has been used instead. The chassis is selfmade from a sheet of polystyrol (PS).

= Features =

 * Avoid obstacles
 * Bluetooth enabled
 * remote control with Android phone


= Hardware =

 * DFRobot Romeo controller
 * DFRobot Ultrasonic sensor URM 37
 * 2 x Pololu 1:100 micro metal gearmotors
 * 2 x Polou Wheels 42mm with wheel encoder option
 * 2 x Pololu motor mount
 * 2 x supporting wheels, Tamiya 70144
 * 1 sheet polystyrol (PS) DinA4, 3mm thick
 * 1 L shape polystyrol profile for the sensor mount
 * 1 x battery holder for 6 AA cells
 * a lot of M3 nuts and bolts
